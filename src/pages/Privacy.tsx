            <p>Large language models generate many responses you see. They do not make decisions that have legal or similarly significant effects on you without human oversight. However, AI output may influence your rental decisions. You acknowledge these limitations and should verify critical information independently.</p>

            <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
