## üö® **CRITICAL GAPS FOR PRODUCTION**

### **1. Data Infrastructure (HIGH PRIORITY)**
**Current State**: CSV data exists but not loaded into production database
**Impact**: Core intelligence features won't work without actual data

**Missing Components:**
- ZIP-level ZORI data not in Supabase tables
- No automated data refresh pipeline
- Sample/hardcoded data in many functions
- No data validation or quality monitoring

**Production Requirements:**
```sql
-- Need these tables populated:
- zip_level_rents (from Zip_zori_uc_sfrcondomfr_sm_sa_month.csv)
- hud_fair_market_rents (from FMR_All_1983_2025.csv)  
- market_predictions (from your prediction system)
- document_chunks (enhanced with location intelligence)
```

### **2. Performance & Scalability (HIGH PRIORITY)**
**Current State**: No caching, potential for slow API responses
**Impact**: Poor user experience under load

**Missing Components:**
- Market data caching layer
- API rate limiting
- Database query optimization
- CDN for static assets

### **3. Advanced Intelligence Features (MEDIUM PRIORITY)**
**Current State**: Basic market analysis without predictive intelligence
**Impact**: "Good" vs "Amazing" user experience

**Missing Components:**
- Success rate predictions by strategy type
- Market timing recommendations
- Landlord/property company intelligence
- Seasonal negotiation factors
- Competitive analysis (what similar tenants pay)
